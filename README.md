# Exploring the Kaggle Data Science Survey
This is an EDA I have done in [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/projects/74) to discover what top tools Kaggle participants use for data science and machine learning. 
The data used in this project comes from the [Kaggle Data Science Survey](https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle/kaggle-survey-2017?utm_medium=partner&utm_source=datacamp.com&utm_campaign=ml+survey+case+study) which includes responses from over 10,000 people that write code to analyze data in their daily work. 
I have done this project using R.
